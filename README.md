# react-nanodegree-readable


# Prerequisite
* Node.js installed on your machine

# Server
* You need to have a server running on  your local machine or deployed.
I have deployed the [Udacity provided server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter "Udacity readable server")
 in [Heroku](https://safe-ridge-45825.herokuapp.com/ "Heroku server") to make things simpler
* change **.env.development.local** file and put the server url properly if you want
to run the server locally


# Installation
    npm install
    npm start
